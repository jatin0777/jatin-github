Gallery and Widget for Instagram Plugin is a simple solution to display your Instagram feed directly onto your website either using a widget or shortcode. You can also show your Instagram feeds in a post or page as well.

== Description ==

Gallery and Widget for Instagram Plugin, a simple yet quality WordPress plugin, will help you create stunning galleries of Instagram images. This plugin adds the posts from your Instagram account that you want to showcase on your website. You can display the Instagram photos from any public Instagram account.

You can add Instagram Feed as Gallery or Widget on your website. Simply either drag-and-drop the plugin in the widget area or you can add a shortcode from your WordPress dashboard if you want to place a copy of your Instagram feed directly onto your post/page.

If you choose to add the Instagram Feed on your widget area, all you need to do is add the title and your Instagram username. You can display up to 20 posts from your public Instagram account. It also gives you the power to customize the size of your Instagram images â€” large, small and thumbnail.

== Features ==

* Super easy to set up
* Completely Responsive and mobile friendly
* Display thumbnail, small or large-size photos from your Instagram feed
* Adjust number of feeds to be displayed, display up to 30 Instagram feeds

**Add as Widget**

Manually, to embed Instagram Feed on posts and pages, add the [catch-instagram-feed-gallery-widget] shortcode to a post or page. The shortcode will display Instagram Feed in different ways, depending on how you use the optional attributes to customize the Instagram Feed.

**Attributes**

* title: Title for Instagram Gallery.
* username: Instagram account's username of which you want to display feed.
* number: Number of feeds in shortcode. Defaults to 6. (number, 1-30)
* size: Select image size to be displayed.

**Example**
